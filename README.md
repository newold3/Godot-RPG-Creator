## 📖 Description

Godot RPG Creator is a suite of tools designed to facilitate the creation of 2D role-playing games, inspired by classics like RPG Maker but with the flexibility and power of Godot. My goal is to offer a free and open-source (MIT License) alternative for the community.

## ✨ Key Features (Current)

What you will find in this Alpha version:

### 🎨 Character Creator
* Simple visual editor.
* Selection of parts and custom coloring.
* Save and load character presets.

### 📚 Complete Database
* **Data Management:** Configuration of Skills, Items, Weapons, Armors, and Enemies with multiple parameters.
* **Battle System (WIP):** Definition of encounters, conditions, and formulas (logic implemented, visual battle in development).
* **Global Configuration:** Settings for vehicles, music, sounds, and a complete **Day/Night** system.

### 🗺️ Advanced Map Editor
* **Map Creation:** Create, edit, and manage multiple maps and scenes.
* **Layers & Terrain:** Terrain painting, ground details (e.g., grass), and environment layers.
* **Lighting & Shadows:** "Cast Shadow" property configurable per tile (with specific width and height).
* **Passability:** Collision configuration and directional passability settings.
* **Depth:** "Keep on Top" option for elements that must always appear above a tile.

### ⚡ Event System
* **Event Commands:** Extensive list of logic and visual commands.
* **Favorites & Search:** Filter commands by name (e.g., "Open") or add them to favorites for quick access.
* **Message Editing:** Integrated commands within text to display faces, names, or play sounds in a single line.
* **Extraction Events:** Base system for gathering/crafting mechanics (requires learned profession).
* **Region Events:** Area-based triggers for logic when entering/exiting zones.

### ⚙️ Other Tools
* **Visual Configuration:** WYSIWYG editor for positioning UI elements and images.
* **Quest System:** Database ready for missions (full implementation in progress).

## 🚀 Roadmap & Upcoming Features

Here is the development plan. I have reorganized the priorities to ensure a stable core before adding complex mechanics like combat.

### 🔥 Immediate Priority (Current Focus)
* **Steampunk UI Completion:** My main goal right now is to finish and polish all the menus in the Steampunk theme (Shops, Themed Dialogues, Item Menu, Skill Menu, and Status Menu).
* **Missing Event Commands:** Implementation of the remaining logic and event commands (excluding Battle-specific commands).

### 🚧 Upcoming Features (Mid-term)
* **Simplified UI Templates:** Development of a standard, simplified version of the menus. The current Steampunk theme uses complex animations and custom scripts; this alternative will be easier to edit and customize for users with less experience.
* **Event Systems:** Integration of the Event Quest System and a Relationship/Reputation system.
* **Vehicles:** Creation of the gameplay scene for the **Water Vehicle**.

### 🔮 Scheduled for Final Phase (Late Alpha)
* **Advanced Battle System:** The logic and visual implementation of the Battle System (Turn-Based/ATB) will be one of the last features to be added.
* **Final Content Polish:** The final configuration of the Database, Tilesets, and Animations will be addressed towards the end of development to ensure they match all implemented systems.

> *Ongoing tasks include continuous bug fixing, code refactoring, and polishing of existing scenes.*

## 🛠️ Development Methodology & Assets

As a solo developer who is not a professional artist, I have adopted a pragmatic approach to ensure the tool is feature-rich and legally safe for distribution:

* **🎨 Assets:** The core visual style is based on **LPC (Liberated Pixel Cup)** standards. However, finding high-quality free assets that explicitly allow **redistribution** (shipping them inside a game engine/tool) is challenging. When a suitable open-license asset is unavailable, I generate a base using AI and then manually fix, polish, and integrate it using Photoshop.
* **💻 Code:** I write all the game logic and systems myself. AI tools are used strictly for **documentation** (generating comments), formatting, or refactoring code that I have already written and tested.
* **✨ Shaders:** The visual effects are a mix of community resources (e.g., GodotShaders) and supervised AI generation.
